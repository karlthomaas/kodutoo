## Frontend

I chose React for frontend, because it's easy to use, flexible, performant and has component-based structure. It also has a lot of libraries and React Hooks that make everyday programming more efficient and pleasent. 


## Backend
For this project I chose express, because it's very lightweight and simple to use. 


## Database
For Database I used Sqlite3, because it's simple to use, powerful and very lightweight. 


## How to run it?
